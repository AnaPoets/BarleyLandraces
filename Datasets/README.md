DATASETS
========
 
These are the datasets and additional files requiered to analyze the landraces as in Poets et al., 2015

SNP's names have been modified adding "X" infront of all BOPA SNPs to have consistant handling of them in R.

Land_6152_SNPs_AB.txt ==> Only landraces genotype file after quality control.

Land_1896SNPs_AB.txt  ==> Genotype containing only the SNPs that were shared between landraces and wild populations (1,896). 
			  Ordered by genetic position

Samples_latlong.txt ==> Latitude/Longitude coordinates for all the 803 landraces used in this project

GeneticMap_iSelect_9k.txt ==> Genetic map for all SNPs in the 9k iSelect platform  

Private_allele_ALLpops.txt ==> A list of the private SNPs at each wild population, and the allele that was private at each SNP. This table was not include in the paper

The raw genotyping data for the 2,446 accessions in the NSGC can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare from entry1466919 to 1466929 (e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1466919).


Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC)
---------------------------------------
The WBDC was analyzed in Fang et. al., 2014 (G3)

WBDC_assig_k6_hap.txt ==> Here we make available the samples assignation to each population identified in that paper.

Wild_1986SNPs_AB.txt  ==> Genotyping data for the WBDC for just those SNPs shared with the landraces.
